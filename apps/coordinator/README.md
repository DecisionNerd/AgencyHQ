# Coordinator

Application boundary for the ledger and policy: authority subset checks,
transition validation, DispatchIntents, run observation, worktree retention,
and recording Lead and human decisions. It triggers Trigger.dev tasks only
after a decision is durable. Runs in the same Node process as the web app.
Token issuance for task adapters arrives with the container profile.

## Package

Package name: `@agencyhq/coordinator`. Scripts: `typecheck` runs `tsc --noEmit`; `test` runs the unit test suite; `test:integration` runs integration tests (requires `pnpm db:up`).
