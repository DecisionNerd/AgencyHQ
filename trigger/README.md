# Trigger.dev task adapters

Task definitions run by `trigger dev` on the OpenCode host (host profile) and,
later, by the deployed supervisor from a task image (container profile).
Tasks: `lead.plan`, `worker.attempt`, `verify.run`, `lead.review`,
`lead.accept`, `integrate.merge`. Each is a thin adapter with no policy: it
does the work, reports progress through run metadata, returns structured
output, and throws `AbortTaskRunError` on contract failures so Trigger does
not retry them. `worker.attempt` performs the worktree-scrub-run-diff-commit
sequence and the `onCancel` checkpoint-and-kill sequence in ADR-0007. Pin the
Trigger image, SDK/CLI, and OpenCode versions together.
